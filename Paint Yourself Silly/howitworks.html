    <h3>Paint Your Own Pottery</h3>
    <p>Our studios are open to walk-ins every day!</p>
    <p>Step 1: Choose your pottery.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Select your paint colors.</p>
    <p>Step 3: Have fun painting!</p>
    <p>For those ages 10 and up, it is $7/hour to paint, and for kids ages 9 and under it is $5/hour.  We recommend allotting at least an hour to paint, but don’t worry, we never charge for more than 2 hours, so you can paint until you faint!</p>
    <p>After your painting session, you leave your art with us and we fire the pottery in our kilns, so you can stay cool!  The usual turn-around time is one week.</p>
    <p>We offer a wide range of pottery that costs anywhere from $3 to $80, so pricing is very flexible!  Our popular items are within the $10-$20 range.</p>
