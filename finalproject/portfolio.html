        <h3>Audio Interview with Ryan Tan</h3>
        <p>One of my passions is video games and esports. I had the opportunity to interview Professor Ryan Tan, a professor at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln and the UNL esports teams coach and advisor.</p> 
            <p>He truly has a wealth of knowledge in the esports and gaming space which I have found to be rare at most institutions.</p>
             <p>He truly is knowledgeable and passionate about the industry.We discussed good coaching practices and what the future of university esports could be.</p>

        <h3>The Watcher<br><span>30 Second Short Film</span></h3>
        <p>The Watcher was a 30 second short film that I shot and produced while at university.</p>
            <p>I utilized Adobe Premiere Pro for editing and I spent a lot of time tinkering with Lumetri coloration to try and create that eery/scary look in the project.</p>
            <p>It was a task to try and make the “monster” in the film not be seen as just a human and that is where I had to do the most tinkering with lumetri colors to make sure to hide just the right amount of their face and body so that it had that eery and mystery style</p>

        <h3>Cotton Candy Sample<br><span>Audiobook Narration</span></h3>
        <p>Cotton Candy is going to be my first published audio book that I had the opportunity to produce and narrate through the University of Nebraska Press that will be released sometime in Summer 2025.</p>
        <p>This is a collection of poetry written by Ted Kooser, a U.S. poet Laureate.</p>
        <p>It was a bit daunting that my first published work is a poetry collection and especially for a notable person, such as Ted Kooser, but I am so glad that I did it.</p>
        <p>I still am doing audio book narration and this was the piece that got me started.</p>
